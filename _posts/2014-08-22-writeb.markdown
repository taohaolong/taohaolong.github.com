This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```


$$
a=b+C

**strong** or __strong__ ( Cmd + B )

*emphasize* or _emphasize_ ( Cmd + I )

**Sometimes I want a lot of text to be bold.
Like, seriously, a _LOT_ of text**
